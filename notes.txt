classes -> form renderer - form handler NOT single full concern clas
form renderer(template OR default OR configvars)
form handler(input data) => sanitize - validate - pass(action OR renderer)
??in this way can avoid needing sessions?? //confirmation needs SESSIONS
handler - renderer can work independently
separate out confirmation too?

config -> FormRenderer -> input -> FormHandler -> (Confirmation -> 
Action OR -> FormRenderer -> repeat)

write any form, give action of form-handler.php (or whatever)
    |
form-handler does work - not valid - valid
                            |           |
                        returned to page with error messages
                                        |
                                    sent to action
isnt this essentially what hapens now just not seperate classes?
